Even tho GitHub officialy removed streaks in May 2016, I kept mine going for almost a decade!

I was 2 months away from reaching 10 years, which I was planning to end the streak at, however I went on vacation and had so much fun I completely forgot to keep the streak going

Here you can see what my streak ended at:
